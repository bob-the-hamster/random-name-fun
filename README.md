# random-name-fun #

This is a simple tool for generating random names.

It has two modes of operation.

## Synthesize by splicing ##

In Synthesize mode, the random name generator attempts to splice together two random words,
joining them together on a pair of letters that they share in common.

Names that come from this mode have fantasy feel to them, but are usually easy to pronounce,
since they are built out of real names.

## Random from dictionary ##

In this mode, the random names are simply pulled from the dictionary, and returned unmodified.
The dictionary is made up from all the capitalized words in a spellchecker dictionary,
so almost all of them are names of people and places from the real world.
